# CodingPortfolio

## Description

This website is designed to show off my growing portfolio to any potential employers or just for some fun information! It is divided into 4 main sections, the showcase of my projects, an about me section, a contact me section, and an interactive photo of my cat for your ammusement!

## User information
Click around and have fun! The main link will link to my other project, the rest of the works are still in progress, so stay tuned and watch this page update!
## Links

FILL THESE LATER!!

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

This project is a solo project, with the help of my teachers in the Full stack bootcamp!
